# X-ray-project
Three CV models to predict pneumonia trained on this <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia"> repo </a> on kaggle

<b> Problem </b>

In the light of current epidemic a NN may come in handy to help radiologists, hence I decided to train a few models that would be a useful in this setting. I've set a goal of validation accuracy over 80%.

<b> Data </b>

As per of repository descirption: 
"The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. "
